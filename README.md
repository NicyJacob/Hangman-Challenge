# Hangman-Challenge
Hangman Challenge - Simulation of the HANGMAN game on terminal (without the drawing feature)

#**Description**
This code is implemented in 2 parts:
1. main.py - This is the main file
2. game.py - This is the file with the game logic. 

The code was written as part of a guided challenge. The code uses Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in Python. OOP helped in implementing the functionalities of the game clearly. It also gives a structured approach to the challenge.

#**Installation**
The code was written using vscode (IDE/Text editor).

#**How to use**
Below is the step-by-step guide to use this code:
1. The game is run on the terminal using this command (python main.py - in case you are using python3, then replace python in the command by python3)
2. The game will give you 5 lives.
3. It will show you the number of letters in the word to be guessed (represented by '_')
4. You can start guessing a letter you think is present in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is present in the word, the position of the letter will be displayed. You can then try to guess the word.
6. If the guessed letter is not present in the word, you can guess another letter.
7. You can continue to guess the word till you find the word or you lose all your lives. (whichever happens earlier)
8. Finally,the game gives you a summary of your play.
